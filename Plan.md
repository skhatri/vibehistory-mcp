# Plan for Command History MCP Implementation

## Overview
This Model Completion Provider (MCP) will intercept, log, and potentially modify all commands sent to AI assistant backends. It will be configured to run first in the MCP chain to ensure it has access to the original user queries.

## Goals
1. Save all commands sent to the AI assistant's backend model
2. Provide options to enrich/edit instructions before sending to the model
3. Allow masking of sensitive information in instructions
4. Be enabled for all queries by default
5. Position as the first MCP in the processing chain

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Basic MCP Structure
- Create a new MCP class called `CommandHistoryMCP`
- Implement the required MCP interface methods
- Set up configuration to ensure it runs first in the MCP chain

### 2. Command Logging Functionality
- Create a data model for storing command history
- Implement a storage mechanism (file-based initially, database optional)
- Add timestamping and session tracking
- Ensure proper error handling and fallbacks

### 3. Command Modification Features
- Implement hooks for modifying commands pre-processing
- Create rule-based system for automatic modifications
- Support for regular expressions for pattern matching
- Add masking functionality for sensitive data

### 4. Configuration Options
- Create configuration schema for the MCP
- Support enabling/disabling specific features
- Allow customization of storage locations
- Configure retention policies

### 5. User Interface Extensions (Optional)
- Add UI components to view command history
- Create interfaces for editing modification rules
- Implement export/import functionality for history

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with the MCP chain
- Performance testing for minimal latency impact

### 7. Security Considerations
- Ensure secure storage of potentially sensitive commands
- Implement proper access controls
- Add encryption options for stored data

## Technical Details

### Storage Format
Commands will be stored in the following format:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "session_id": "session-identifier",
  "original_command": "raw command text",
  "modified_command": "command after processing",
  "modifications": [
    {
      "type": "mask|edit|enrich",
      "pattern": "pattern matched",
      "replacement": "text replaced with"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "position": "first",
  "storage": {
    "type": "file|database",
    "path": "./command_history",
    "retention_days": 30
  },
  "modifications": [
    {
      "name": "mask_credentials",
      "type": "mask",
      "pattern": "password\\s*:\\s*\\S+",
      "replacement": "password: [REDACTED]",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Timeline
1. Basic structure and logging - Day 1
2. Command modification system - Day 2
3. Configuration and integration - Day 3
4. Testing and refinement - Day 4
5. Documentation and packaging - Day 5

## Dependencies
- Core MCP framework
- Storage library (depends on chosen storage mechanism)
- Pattern matching library

## Next Steps
After initial implementation, consider:
1. Adding visualization tools for command history
2. Implementing analytics on command patterns
3. Creating shareable modification rule sets
